/**
 * FastaReader iterates over a FASTA file, returning Sequence objects, without
 * storing the whole database in RAM (unlike many other implementations).
 *
 * Sequences are expected to be represented in the standard IUB/IUPAC amino
 * acid and nucleic acid codes, with these exceptions: lower-case letters
 * are accepted and are mapped into upper-case; a single hyphen or dash can
 * be used to represent a gap of indeterminate length; and in amino acid
 * sequences, U and * are acceptable letters (see below). Before submitting
 * a request, any numerical digits in the query sequence should either be
 * removed or replaced by appropriate letter codes (e.g., N for unknown
 * nucleic acid residue or X for unknown amino acid residue).
