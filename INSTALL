= INSTALL BioScala =

To try BioScala build the class files and add them to the class path. A jar 
file will be provided in the future.

For BioScala install Scala, JRuby and the JAVA compiler. On Debian:

  apt-get install scala jruby sun-java6-jdk

Other (possible) dependencies are:

* BioRuby:   Unpack the BioRuby source and point the Ruby load path to the
             lib folder therein, e.g.:

               export RUBYLIB=~/local/lib/bioruby/lib

* JRuby:     Install jruby and add the big jruby-complete.jar file to the 
             class path, like jruby-complete-1.5.0.RC1.jar (check the version
						 of your JRuby with the -v switch: jruby -v)

* BioJAVA:   Add the biojava.jar file to the class path

* scalatest: Add the scalatest.jar file to the class path

Currently the following jar files are in the class path:

	biojava-1.7.1.jar  
	biojava3-core-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar       
	biojava3-alignment-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  
	biojava3-genome-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (optional)
  biojava3-phylo-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
	jruby-complete-1.5.0.RC1.jar  (optional)
	scalatest-1.0.1.jar

Install sbt (Simple build tool) and run on the command line:

  cd bioscala
	sbt
	> test

if sbt has trouble finding jars, check ./project/build/bioscala.scala
