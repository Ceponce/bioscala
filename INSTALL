= INSTALL BioScala =

To try BioScala build the class files and add them to the class path. A jar 
file will be provided in the future.

For BioScala install Scala, JRuby and the JAVA compiler. On Debian:

  apt-get install scala jruby sun-java6-jdk

Other dependencies are:

* BioRuby:   Unpack the BioRuby source and point the Ruby load path to the
             lib folder therein, e.g.:

               export RUBYLIB=~/local/lib/bioruby/lib

* JRuby:     Install jruby and add the big jruby-complete.jar file to the 
             class path, like jruby-complete-1.5.0.RC1.jar (check the version
						 of your JRuby with the -v switch: jruby -v)

* BioJAVA:   Add the biojava.jar file to the class path

* scalatest: Add the scalatest.jar file to the class path

With this in place you should have access to all functionality.
